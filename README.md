# party-recognition-neuronal-net-bpn
Pattern Recognition using a Neuronal Net approach.

The idea is to create a system to recognized gesture patterns for games. The Neuronal net need to be trained using sample gesture.
For now works well trying to recognize no more of 4 patterns, but it get confused easily due to the math behind it. Need to define a better algorithm
